How to Install and Run Jupylet
------------------------------

If you are new to Python, I strongly recommend that you install and use the
`Miniconda Python <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
distribution. Download and run the 64-bit installer and stick to the default
install options.

Once Miniconda is installed start a Miniconda Prompt. To do this on Windows
click the :guilabel:`âŠž Winkey`  then search for "Miniconda Prompt" and
click it. This should open a small dark window that programmers call *console*
or *shell* in which you can enter commands and run programs.

To run *jupylet* first install it by typing the following command in the console:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install jupylet

Next, download and extract the `jupylet archive
<https://github.com/nir/jupylet/archive/master.zip>`_ or use
`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to clone the jupylet repository with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/nir/jupylet.git

Next, enter the *jupylet/examples/* directory with the change directory
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ./jupylet/examples/

And start a jupyter notebook with:

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter notebook spaceship.ipynb

Run the notebook and a game canvas should appear with the spaceship example:

Hello, World!
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from jupylet.label import Label
    from jupylet.app import App

    app = App(width=320, height=64)
    hello = Label('hello, world', color='cyan', font_size=32, x=app.width, y=16)

    @app.event
    def on_draw():
        app.window.clear()
        hello.draw()

    @app.run_me_again_and_again(1/30)
    def scroll(dt):
        hello.x -= 1
        if hello.x < -220:
            hello.x = app.width

    app.run()
