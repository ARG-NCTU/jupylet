Jupylet's Documentation
=======================

Jupylet is a Python library that lets you create and run games interactively
in a Jupyter notebook. It is intended for two types of audiences:

* Kids and their parents interested in learning to program,
* Researchers and students of deep reinforcement learning.


Kids Learning to Program:
-------------------------

A Jupyter notebook is in essence a laboratory for programming. It is the ideal
environment for playing around with code, experimenting, and exploring ideas.
It is used by professional machine learning scientists who come every day to
play at work, so why not by kids?

Jupylet is built on top of pyglet, a powerful game programming library. It is
wonderfully easy to use for creating simple 2D games and since pyglet uses
OpenGL you can use it to create 3D games if you really want to. The sky is the
limit really.

But that is not all. Jupylet lets you create games interactively. Change a
variable or a function and the game will be affected immediately while it is
running.


Deep Reinforcement Learning with Jupylet:
-----------------------------------------

Jupylet makes it is super easy to create novel environments in which to
experiment with deep reinforcement learning algorithms and it includes the code
required to programmatically control multiple simultaneous games and render
thousands of frames per second.
