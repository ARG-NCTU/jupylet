INTRODUCTION
============

*Jupylet* is a Python library that lets you create and run games interactively
in a Jupyter notebook. It is intended for two types of audiences:

* Kids and their parents interested in learning to program,
* Computer scientists, researchers, and students of deep reinforcement learning.


Jupylet for Kids
----------------

A Jupyter notebook is in essence a laboratory for programming. It is the ideal
environment for playing around with code, experimenting, and exploring ideas.
It is used by professional machine learning scientists who come every day to
play at work, so why not by kids?

*Jupylet* is wonderfully easy to use for creating simple 2D and 3D games 
interactively and experimentally. Change a variable or a function and see how 
the game is affected immediately while it is running.

Jupylet for Deep Reinforcement Learning
---------------------------------------

*Jupylet* makes it is super easy to create and modify environments in which to
experiment with deep reinforcement learning algorithms and it includes the API
to programmatically control multiple simultaneous games and render thousands 
of frames per second.

Consider for example the pong game included in this repository. With a few
lines of code you can modify the colors of the game to experiment with transfer 
learning, or turn the game into 4-way pong with agents on all four sides of the 
game court to experiment with cooperation between multiple agents. And since you 
can modify the game interactively in Jupyter this process is not only easy but 
also fun.
