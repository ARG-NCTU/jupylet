A Few Words on Notebooks
------------------------

A Jupyter notebook lets you mix formatted text with computer code and graphics.
Jupyter notebooks belong to the more general category of `computational
notebooks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface>`_.

Computational notebooks are the modern version of the traditional scientist's
laboratory notebook. Such notebooks have been used by scientists for hundreds
of years to keep track of their ideas and experiments in physics, chemistry,
biology, etc...

The most interesting thing about Jupyter notebooks is that when it comes to
computer science and data science they mix the laboratory and the notebook into
one. That is, a Jupyter notebook is also a computing laboratory since you can
actually run the Python code in them!

Here is a very special example of a traditional laboratory notebook. A page
from `Galileo Galilei's <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei>`_
notebook in which he documented his first observations of the moons of Jupiter
400 years ago:

You can think of it as the first Jupiter notebook ðŸ˜Ž and if you know Italian
let me know what it says.
